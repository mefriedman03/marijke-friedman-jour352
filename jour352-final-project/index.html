                As has been the case at several joint appearances since last
                fall, Friday night’s debate between Prince George’s County
                Executive Angela Alsobrooks and U.S. Rep. David Trone of Potomac
                yielded a dearth of differences over policy issues in their race
                for the Democratic nomination to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Ben
                Cardin (D-Baltimore).
            </p>
            <p>
                But that didn’t pre-empt the two from again clashing on matters
                ranging from their resumes to how they are financing their
                campaigns—along with who is better positioned to defeat the
                likely Republican nominee, former Gov. Larry Hogan, this fall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Friday’s session appeared likely to be the only televised debate
                prior to the May 14 primary, with the start of early voting in
                that contest less than two weeks away. The debate–sponsored by
                The Baltimore Sun, the University of Baltimore and
                Baltimore-based WBFF/Fox 45, and broadcast from the studios of
                the latter–was available for viewing in the Washington area on
                WBFF’s sister station, News Channel 8.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looming over the debate was a poll commissioned earlier this
                week by the debate sponsors showing Trone with a double-digit
                lead over Alsobrooks in the race for the Democratic nomination,
                as well as the publication Thursday of The Washington Post’s
                endorsement of Alsobrooks in the Democratic primary.
            </p>
            <div
                class="flourish-embed flourish-chart"

            </div>
            <p>
                The encounter also took place after the latest campaign
                disclosure reports were filed with the Federal Election
                Commission this past week showing Trone–co-owner of Total Wine &
                More, a nationwide chain of alcohol beverage retail
                outlets–spending nearly $42 million out of his own pocket to
                largely self-finance his candidacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This race will be decided by the people, by the many–and not by
                the money,” Alsobrooks declared at one point, while adding:
                “Money can’t buy you love, and it really cannot buy you
                Maryland.” She called for reform of the current campaign finance
                system “because these kinds of campaigns should be about people,
                it should not be about money.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Her comments came after Trone, as he has in the past, argued
                that self-funding gave him an independence that he suggested
                other candidates, such as his opponent, lacked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “In the last two-year [election] cycle, $1.9 billion of special
                interest money came into the Congress – that’s what we have to
                stop,” Trone declared, referring to donations from political
                action committees (PACs), which he has refused to accept. “We’ve
                got to get the money out of politics that’s really poisoning our
                system.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Trone doubled-down on this front throughout the debate, and took
                aim at Alsobrooks in his closing statement, after she had called
                for an increase in corporate taxes to help deal with the
                mushrooming federal debt. “It’s going to be tough to raise taxes
                on those big companies when you’re taking all their dollars:
                That’s a challenge,” he told Alsobrooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a “Fact Check” statement emailed to reporters during the
                debate, the Trone campaign cited recent FEC disclosure reports
                in charging that Alsobrooks had received “more than $230,000”
                from lobbyists for energy and utility firms, along with $25,000
                from groups representing the pharmaceutical industry and another
                $25,000 from those associated with the insurance industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Campaign finance also took front and center when the two
                candidates were asked about the abortion issue, on which they
                agree in substance–with both vowing to push for efforts to
                codify the Roe v. Wade decision, overturned by the U.S. Supreme
                Court in 2022, into law.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Trone noted that his family foundation had helped to
                underwrite a reproductive health services clinic in
                Republican-dominated Allegany County near the West Virginia
                border, Alsobrooks–as she has done at several candidate forums
                in recent months–highlighted contributions made by Trone
                personally and by his company, Total Wine & More, to
                anti-abortion Republicans in states such as Texas and Georgia.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I want to make sure the record is clear here: Mr. Trone has
                given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the most radical
                Republicans who have passed the most restrictive abortion laws
                in our country,” Alsobrooks declared.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trone, who at several past forums has defended these
                contributions to Republicans as necessary to protect the jobs of
                Total Wine & More employees in Republican-dominated states, did
                not directly respond to Alsobrooks’ attacks Friday. But he did
                point to the scope of his largesse to Democratic candidates at
                the federal level in recent years.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Over the past couple of decades, I’ve given $20 million to
                Democrats at the federal level,” Trone said. “I’m the largest
                donor to Democrats in the last three cycles.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The verbal jousting between Alsobrooks and Trone began in
                earnest about a quarter of the way into the hour-long debate
                over the question of the death penalty. While both have backed
                repeal of the federal death penalty during the campaign, Trone
                sought to highlight past differences between them on that issue.
            </p>
            <img>
            <p>
                One of the panel of questioners, Jeff Barker of the Sun, asked
                Alsobrooks about a decision in 2011–her first year as Prince
                George County’s state’s attorney–to seek the death penalty in a
                case in which four people were murdered, including two young
                children.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Marylanders have spoken, and they have decided that the death
                penalty is no longer the law of the land in Maryland, and I
                agree with Maryland voters,” Alsobrooks responded, referring to
                a 2012 ballot referendum a year after the case in question–in
                which she ultimately sought a life sentence without parole
                “because I believe people who harm and murder children deserve
                the stiffest penalty available.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Asked about proposals to repeal the death penalty at the federal
                level, Alsobrooks responded, “I can tell you that I would also
                not support the death penalty on the federal level.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Declared Trone: “I’m the only candidate on the stage who has
                always been 100 percent opposed to the death penalty. We know
                the death penalty is racist, it feeds our systemically racist
                system that we have in the criminal justice area.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Pointing to his $20 million endowment to establish the American
                Civil Liberties Union’s Trone Center for Justice and Equality,
                with 45 attorneys who “work in New York City and around the
                country to fix our criminal justice system that is so broken,”
                Trone added: “There have been hundreds and hundreds of folks
                exonerated by DNA evidence later on that were [sentenced] to the
                death penalty and were saved. Think about the hundreds of others
                that were not so lucky, who were not saved.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Alsobrooks utilized the death penalty discussion to contrast the
                type of experience she has had in public office with that of
                Trone.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m the only person in this race who has had the awesome
                responsibility of keeping our community safe,” she said. “To
                work to keep families of the community safe, I have had to hold
                mothers who lost young children, and I have had to hold husbands
                who had lost their wives. And I can tell you these are not easy
                cases.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She later cited her experience in public administration during a
                discussion of the recent collapse of the Baltimore’s Key Bridge.
                “Voting is just one part–there are people in Washington who
                think voting is all of it,” said Alsobrooks–who, besides being
                the state’s first Black senator if elected, would be the first
                Maryland senator in 60 years not to have served previously in
                the U.S. House.
            </p>
            <p>
                She continued: “I’ve been able not only to get the funding, but
                to turn the funding into real infrastructure. I have built
                schools, I have built hospitals, I have built roads.”
            </p>
            <p>
                For his part, Trone – while seeking to emphasize his credentials
                as a “progressive Democrat” – touted his work across the
                political aisle in three terms in the House. “That’s what I’ve
                worked really hard at … in Congress – how to build that
                bipartisan connectivity with the other side,” he said.

            <p>
                Despite his House tenure, Trone continued past efforts to
                contrast himself with Alsobrooks, who has spent her entire
                career in government. “The biggest thing that distinguishes my
                candidacy is that I’m not a career politician who just goes from
                one job to the next job to the next job. I’m a public servant.
                I’m here to work for the folks of Maryland,” Trone declared,
                asserting, “I’m here to make big changes, and not to owe anybody
                to make those changes.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Hogan’s surprise entry into the contest just before the Feb. 9
                filing deadline loomed over Friday’s debate, as Alsobrooks and
                Trone also jousted in response to a question about their ability
                to defeat Hogan, a popular two-term Republican governor despite
                Maryland’s 2-1 edge in registered Democratic voters.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Every single poll has said the same thing–I’m the candidate who
                can beat Larry Hogan,” Trone said. “Not one poll has said
                anything different. And not one poll has ever said my opponent
                can beat Larry Hogan, because she won’t.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I have the resources to beat Larry Hogan. And I have the
                persona to win across the state…I’ve won in a Republican
                district.”
            </p>
            <p>
                That gave Alsobrooks an opening to swipe at Trone for past
                financial contributions to Hogan, following his first campaign
                for governor in 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I think it’s really interesting that Mr. Trone says he’s the
                person who can take on Larry Hogan and beat him when, not so
                long ago, he was a Larry Hogan donor,” Alsobrooks said,
                contending that Trone provided Hogan “with the funding that he
                needed to carry across his agenda, which included restricting
                abortion care in the state of Maryland. So I believe what we
                don’t need is a Larry Hogan donor trying to take on Larry Hogan
                in the fall.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In an email during the debate, the Alsobrooks campaign pointed
                to a 2018 Washington Post story that noted several businesses
                controlled by Trone had donated $30,000 to help Hogan retire his
                campaign debt four years earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alsobrooks, who has received the lion’s share of endorsements
                from the state’s congressional delegation and statewide
                officials, including Democratic Gov. Wes Moore cited this as a
                plus in the effort to head off Hogan. “We have a broad and
                growing coalition across the state of Maryland that I am so
                proud of. That coalition includes over 190 people elected
                throughout the state of Maryland,” she said.
            </p>
            <p>
                She added, “I think it’s important to point out that six of our
                seven [Maryland] congressional [delegation] members–all of Mr.
                Trone’s colleagues–have endorsed me in this race.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Her arithmetic was a bit off: Six of eight Democrats in the
                Maryland congressional delegation besides Trone, including U.S.
                Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Kensington and U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin
                of Takoma Park, are behind Alsobrooks. Of the remaining two,
                U.S. Rep. C.A. “Dutch” Ruppersberger of Baltimore County is
                backing Trone, while Cardin has opted to remain neutral in the
                primary contest to succeed him.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The insiders all thought this would be a coronation. It’s not,”
                declared Trone. “I’ve been the underdog from Day One.”
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, Trone, too, touted his endorsements –
                including “the entire Democratic leadership” of the House, among
                them Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Minority
                Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts. Closer to home, he
                pointed to a couple of prominent residents of Alsobrooks’s home
                county who were backing him: Maryland Attorney General Anthony
                Brown, whose successful 2022 campaign benefited from a $350,000
                independent ad expenditure by Trone, and Prince George’s County
                State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy, who endorsed Trone a day prior
                to the debate.

                Braveboy’s endorsement came the same day as the Washington Post
                endorsement of Alsobrooks, which Trone sought to defuse with a
                bit of humor.

                “The Washington Post had a lot of really nice positive things to
                say. And I thank them for that,” Trone said. “But, at the same
                time, I kind of feel like I dodged the bullet–I mean, the last
                time they got it wrong for governor, they got it wrong for
                attorney general, they got it wrong for comptroller. So let’s
                hope they can keep their streak up.”

                Trone was two-thirds correct: In the 2022 Democratic primary,
                the Post endorsed two losing candidates: former U.S. Labor
                Secretary Tom Perez for governor and former Baltimore District
                Judge Katie O’Malley for attorney general. But the Post’s choice
                for comptroller–then-Del. Brooke Lierman of Baltimore, who is
                backing Alsobrooks this year—won the primary and went on to win
                in November.
